<h1>PwC Power BI Machine Learning and Projects</h1> 

<p>This course required three projects for 1) gender DEI, 2) customer churn, and 3) call center analytics. Power BI dashboards and machine learning models were created for three projects.</p>

<h2>Gender DEI Project</h2>

Machine Learning Model<br>

PRA status, Time in Job Level, Age and Years since last hire were used to classify as gender. 

<h3>Results</h3><br>

<b>Support Vector Classifier</b><br>

<b>KNN</b><br> 
k = 7<br>
70% accuracy<br> 


Your task is to do the following:

Define relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and create a visualisation.

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

<h2>Customer Churn</h2><br>

<p>A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.
</p>
<p>
In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:
</p>
<p>
Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
</p>
<p>
We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management.
The Retentions Manager has provided some information, have a look through the resource section.
</p>

Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

<b>Define proper KPIs</b>
<br>
Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed.

<p>
It’s omnipresent: telecom marketing. Better price here. Better service there. Best for small businesses here. Best for young urbanites there. But what do customers really want? Our client, a big telecom company needs to know. An email just arrived for you. 
</p>
<p>
Create a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative! 
</p>

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

Overall customer satisfaction
Overall calls answered/abandoned
Calls by time
Average speed of answer
Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

<h3>Machine Learning Model</h3>

Predictive models were made to determine whether a call was resolved or not. Speed to answer in seconds, the call's duration (minutes and seconds) and customer satisfaction were used to make the classification.<br>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Classification models can be a viable method to classify a binary outcome feature for customer churn, call center analytics, and gender DEI with the provided datasets. Future projects may use other algorithms and techniques to explore the datasets. Examples include regression, association rules, and statistical testing.
